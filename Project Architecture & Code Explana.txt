Project Architecture & Code Explanation
This document explains how the DevOps Clothing App works, detailing the code structure and how the Frontend, Backend, and Database interact.

1. High-Level Architecture
The application follows a standard 3-Tier Architecture:

Presentation Layer (Frontend): React application running in the browser.
Logic Layer (Backend): Node.js/Express server handling API requests.
Data Layer (Database): MongoDB storing the clothing items.
Docker is used to containerize each of these layers so they can run anywhere without installing Node or Mongo locally.

    Frontend -- Fetch API (Port 5000) --> Backend[Backend Container (Node/Express)]
    Backend -- Mongoose (Port 27017) --> DB[(MongoDB Container)]
2. Code Files Explained
Backend (/backend)
server.js This is the heart of the backend.

MongoDB Connection: Connects to the MongoDB container (mongodb://mongo:27017/clothing-app).
Product Schema: Defines the data structure (name, price, image, description).
Seeding Logic: On startup, if the DB is empty, it inserts 9 items with high-quality Unsplash images.
API Endpoints:
GET /api/products: Returns all products (for the home page).
GET /api/products/:id: Returns a single product by ID (for the details page).
Dockerfile

Uses node:22-alpine (latest LTS Node.js).
Installs dependencies and runs node server.js.
Frontend (/frontend)
src/App.jsx

Router Setup: Uses react-router-dom to handle navigation.
Routes:
/: Renders <ProductList /> (Home).
/product/:id: Renders <ProductDetails /> (Details Page).
src/ProductList.jsx

Fetches all products from GET /api/products.
Displays them in a responsive grid.
Wraps each card in a <Link> tag so clicking it navigates to the details page.
src/ProductDetails.jsx

Uses useParams() to get the product ID from the URL.
Fetches specific details from GET /api/products/:id.
Displays the large image, description, and an interactive "Add to Cart" button.
src/index.css

Contains the styling rules (Glassmorphism, Dark Mode).
Includes animations for page transitions.
Dockerfile

Stage 1 (Build): Compiles React code using Node 22.
Stage 2 (Serve): Serves the static files using Nginx.
DevOps (root)
docker-compose.yml Orchestrates the 3 services:

mongo: Database with persistent volume.
backend: Node API, depends on Mongo.
frontend: React UI, depends on Backend.
3. How It Works Together (The User Flow)
Home Page:

User visits http://localhost.
App.jsx loads ProductList.
ProductList fetches all items from Backend -> MongoDB.
User sees the grid of 9 items.
Navigation:

User clicks an item.
React Router changes URL to /product/123... without reloading the page (Single Page App).
App.jsx switches view to ProductDetails.
Details Page:

ProductDetails grabs the ID 123... from the URL.
It asks Backend for "Product 123".
Backend asks MongoDB for "Product 123".
Data returns and is displayed with a large image.
User clicks "Add to Cart" -> JavaScript alert confirms action.
